// ----- Arithmetic and Assignment Operator on Data Type (number) -----

const x = 10; // = is assignment operator
const y = 20; 
const z = x + y; // + is an arithmetic operator that sums x and y, the resolved value is assigned to z with = operator.
console.log(z); // 30



// ----- Arithmetic and Assignment Operator on Data Type (string) -----

const a = "10"; // the value of a string data type is surrounded with double quote (").
const b = "20";
const c = a + b; // string cannot behaviour like number, so it is being concatenated.
console.log(c); // "1020"
