# Pre-lesson Work

## Brief

In this pre-class work, you will be self-revising on:

1. What are `data types`
1. How to initialize variables with `const` and `let` 
1. What are the differences between `const` and `let`
1. When do `undefined` type occurs and when do we use `null` type

Go through this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp) (W3schools JavaScript Tutorial on Variables). 

Additional Learning:

- What are [comments](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comments.asp)?
- JavaScript adopts the camelCase convention when declaring variables. See the four types of cases [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/snake-case-vs-camel-case-vs-pascal-case-vs-kebab-case-whats-the-difference).
- Why should we not use `var` in a simple example [here](./src/prelessonwork/var-example.js).
